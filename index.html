      While making this I had so many doubts that maybe you wouldn't like one
      thing or another, but when you talked with me last night, I was reminded
      of why I love you so much. I was reminded of why we won't just be together
      for 100 days, but we'll be together for 100 more days and 100 more weeks
      and more and more. It's because you care so deeply about us and I feel the
      same! You’re so 헌신적인 and 보살피는!!!! I love you so much and I will
      forever be grateful for how you’ve changed my life and brought light into
      it ❤️.
    </p>
    <p>
      That being said… 100 days!!! Think about it! Even though it’s just the
      start, that's a great thing! These 100 days with you have been the most
      meaningful part of my life, and that’s because you’re the best girlfriend
      ever!!!
    </p>
    <p>
      Looking back on these 100 days, I’ve seen all the amazing things you’ve
      done for me, are great memories, how awesome you are, and how I want our
      future to be us together 🥰.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sometimes it feels like a dream. You’re so precious! I love how you’re
      always thinking of me. It’s humbling how kind you are to me!
    </p>
    <p>
      I love your smile! Every time you smile and your face just lights up is so
      cute! I like when you smile, because it reflects how you affect me… You
      make me smile and happy, and you deserve to be the same 🥹. I still
      remember you after Comic World, I was so happy to see you like that!
    </p>
    <p>
      I love how you always tell me that I’m cute 😖, especially when I'm having
      a hard day. And you’re always so supportive of me!!! You tell me that I’m
      great at work, and you help me code by giving me motivation 🥰. You’ve
      always been there for me no matter what. You’ve been there when I feel bad
      or when I need anything. How could I ever repay that? 😣. You’re perfect
      to me!!!! Remember the presents you gave me??? I love it every day and its
      so warming to my heart. 💗
    </p>
    <p>
      You’ve made me realize that not everything is transactional… You’ve made
      me realize what true love feels like 🥹. Remember yesterday? Remember that
      one day I was so sad I ended the call for a little bit? You’ve always been
      there for me! Even after I called back you were there! That means so much
      to me… You’re love is the most important thing 💕.
    </p>
    <p>
      Or remember the week or two ago I was sleeping and I was so tired that
      night. You were with your friends but it was so nice just to have you on
      the other end of that call. When I feel like that, calling you like that
      reminds me… That all that matters is you 🥰...
    </p>
    <p>
      Thank you for reading this! I know it was long 😖. I could never express
      all of my love for you but I hope this shows a part of it! Lets have
      hundreds of more memories and days okay? I love you 가현 🫰💗💕💕💗
